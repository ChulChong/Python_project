# a python project : Loan Application

#### Member name : Chul Chong, Crystle Yi

# Setting:
When a person applies for a loan, there are variables that decide if the loan gets approved or not. All this is based on the person’s description and details they provide. This project will be about how a loan application generally works based on what is given as the input.

# Setup:
What we can do is make a separate spreadsheet or a CSV ( Comma Separated Value) file. This is a way of representing a table in a file. Each line represents a row on a table and the cells in the columns are separated by commas. 
We will ask the user for the variable descriptions of the dataset given: Loan_ID, Gender, Dependents, etc. After the inputs, the user will name the file, and we will have the program add a “.csv” extension to the name to make it a CSV file.
Based on the inputs, the program will be able to determine if the application will be approved or not. How we make the program work will be a work in progress and many testing will be needed, but using the CSV to do this will be a major part of this project.
The rest will be basic coding with if loops or whatever we will test with. Output will be listing the load application input and then determining if the application is approved or not. Seems straight and basic, but either way, other than the CSV part, the rest will be done via testing several coding and time.
